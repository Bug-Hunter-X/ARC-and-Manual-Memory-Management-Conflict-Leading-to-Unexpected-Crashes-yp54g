In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and manual memory management using techniques like `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  Consider the scenario where an object is allocated and initialized, then its retain count is manually incremented, but then the object is passed to another method which expects ownership without additional retain calls. If the owning method doesn't retain this object, the original owner might release it before the other method is done using it, causing a crash due to accessing deallocated memory. This is difficult to debug because the immediate crash site may not directly reflect the actual point of memory mismanagement.

Example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    NSString *str = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@
